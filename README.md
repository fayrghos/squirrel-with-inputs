Here we only love Rust!!!!!1

ONLY RUST ALLOWED!!!!!!!



OMG imagine using that disgusting language over RUST. As a proud rustacean, I’m going to inform you: that’s blasphemy. You can do better. Grab cargo and start using a beautiful memory managed, statically typed, comfortable yet low level language with a spectacular packaging system. No more memory leaks. No more makefiles. End the weird bugs caused by unrequested type casting. Easily find libraries. AND ALL OF THAT IS BLAZING FAST (at C/cpp-level speeds - yay compiled langs and llvm c:). Why wouldn’t you? The syntax is spectacular as well; extremely clean, much better than anything else out there. Those match statements are so extremely pleasant, and the looping conventions are orgasmic. And the compiler is the most useful and polite you’ll come across; no more endlessly scrolling segmentation fault and template errors. It’s amazing and I love it and you should switch now because it’s far superior to literally everything else, all those gross languages you’re used to using. Come to rust and you’ll never look back, it’s so versatile and cleeeeean. Graydon Hoare is literally a god. The rust book is my bible. this is my religion now. USE RUST
